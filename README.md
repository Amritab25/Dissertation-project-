## Agent description
- Tools
  * Lipinski
  * Substitution
  * Pharmacophore
- LLM
- Sample prompts
  * Generate analogues of the molecule and find the best one and test the pharmacophore for the best one.
  * Evaluate pharmacophore features and Lipinskis compliance for drug-likeness.
  * Analyse how substituent changes influence pharmacophore mapping and binding efficiency
  * Investigate how fluorine substitution affects Lipinski's properties such as logP and molecualr weight
  * Determine how fluorine substitution influences Lipinskis hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
  * Assess substituion pattern affects on Lipinski parameters across fluorobezene isomer
  * Explain how fluorine substitution alters pharmacophore aromatic and hydrophobic regions
  * Examine fluorine substitution influence on pharmacophore H bond acceptor and aromatic centroid positions
